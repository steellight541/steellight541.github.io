        <p>
            Hello, I'm steel. I'm a student at VIVES Noord Brugge.
            I'm currently studying Electronics-ICT. I started at 2023 and hope to graduate in 2026.
            I already started programming in my free time at the age of 13.
            I started with some arduino and then later on moved to C-languages and python.
            My current knowledge is mostly in C, C++, C#, Python and some webdev (html, css, js).
            I'm currently learning a blazor maui hybrid app for a big school project. which i hope to finish soon so that i can tell you more about it.
            Some projects that im working on that are some personal projects i will tell you about later in the page.
        </p>
